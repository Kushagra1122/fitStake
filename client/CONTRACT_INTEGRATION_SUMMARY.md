**Contract Address:** `0xbaf067fe68f032d9fdc906c6dcb32299baa2404f`  
**Network:** Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11155111)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Contract Service (`client/services/contract.js`)
‚úÖ **Updated contract address** to the correct deployed address  
‚úÖ **Added full ABI** from compiled contract artifacts  
‚úÖ **Fixed createChallenge()** - Uses `description` parameter instead of `name`, converts km‚Üímeters, days‚Üíseconds  
‚úÖ **Implemented getActiveChallenges()** - Queries `nextChallengeId` and fetches all active challenges  
‚úÖ **Implemented getUserChallenges()** - Filters challenges by user participation  
‚úÖ **Implemented joinChallenge()** - Sends ETH value with transaction  
‚úÖ **Implemented withdrawWinnings()** - Allows users to claim rewards after finalization  
‚úÖ **Implemented finalizeChallenge()** - Allows anyone to finalize expired challenges  
‚úÖ **Added getProvider()** - Returns JsonRpcProvider for Sepolia  

**Key Data Conversions:**
- Distance: KM √ó 1000 = Meters (contract format)
- Duration: Days √ó 86400 = Seconds (contract format)
- Stake Amount: ETH string ‚Üí Wei (using `ethers.parseEther()`)
- Display: Wei ‚Üí ETH (using `ethers.formatEther()`)

### 2. Web3Context (`client/context/Web3Context.js`)
‚úÖ **Added getProvider()** - Returns ethers JsonRpcProvider for reading blockchain data  
‚úÖ **Added getSigner()** - Creates custom signer that wraps WalletConnect for transactions  
‚úÖ **Exported in context value** - Both functions now available to all screens

### 3. CreateChallenge Screen (`client/screens/CreateChallenge.js`)
‚úÖ **Imported getSigner** from Web3Context  
‚úÖ **Uncommented and fixed contract integration** in `handleCreateChallenge()`  
‚úÖ **Proper parameter mapping** - `challengeName` ‚Üí `description`  
‚úÖ **Transaction handling** - Shows transaction hash in success alert  
‚úÖ **Error handling** - Displays user-friendly error messages

### 4. JoinChallenge Screen (`client/screens/JoinChallenge.js`)
‚úÖ **Imported getProvider and getSigner** from Web3Context  
‚úÖ **Implemented loadChallenges()** - Fetches active challenges from contract  
‚úÖ **Implemented handleJoinChallenge()** - Joins challenge with proper stake amount  
‚úÖ **Transaction confirmation** - Shows transaction hash and reloads challenges  
‚úÖ **Wallet check** - Validates user is connected before joining

### 5. MyChallenges Screen (`client/screens/MyChallenges.js`)
‚úÖ **Imported getProvider, getSigner, and withdrawWinnings**  
‚úÖ **Implemented loadMyChallenges()** - Fetches user's participated challenges  
‚úÖ **Implemented handleCompleteChallenge()** - Allows withdrawing winnings after finalization  
‚úÖ **Added finalization checks** - Validates challenge is finalized before withdrawal  
‚úÖ **Added withdrawal status check** - Prevents double withdrawal

### 6. Home Screen (`client/screens/Home.js`)
‚úÖ **Added real-time stats** - Displays actual active challenges count  
‚úÖ **Calculated total staked** - Sums ETH staked across active challenges  
‚úÖ **Imported getUserChallenges and getProvider**  
‚úÖ **Auto-updates on account change** - Reloads stats when wallet changes

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
1. **WalletConnect Project ID** - Get one from https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
2. **Sepolia ETH** - Get test ETH from https://sepoliafaucet.com/
3. **MetaMask Mobile** - Install MetaMask app on your phone

### Running the App

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Testing the Integration

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Open the app and connect your MetaMask wallet via WalletConnect
   - Make sure you're on Sepolia testnet

2. **Create a Challenge**
   - Go to "Create Challenge"
   - Fill in: Name, Activity Type, Target Distance (km), Duration (days), Stake Amount (ETH)
   - Confirm transaction in MetaMask
   - Wait for transaction confirmation

3. **Join a Challenge**
   - Go to "Join Challenge"
   - Browse available challenges
   - Click "Join Challenge" and confirm stake amount
   - Approve transaction in MetaMask

4. **View Your Challenges**
   - Go to "My Challenges"
   - See all challenges you've participated in
   - View active vs completed tabs
   - Withdraw winnings after challenge is finalized

5. **Dashboard Stats**
   - Home screen shows:
     - Active Challenges count
     - Total staked ETH
     - All synchronized from blockchain

## Contract Functions Used

### Write Functions (Require Gas)
- `createChallenge(description, targetDistance, stakeAmount, duration)` - Creates new challenge
- `joinChallenge(challengeId)` - Joins existing challenge (payable)
- `withdrawWinnings(challengeId)` - Claims rewards after finalization
- `finalizeChallenge(challengeId)` - Finalizes expired challenge

### Read Functions (Free)
- `nextChallengeId()` - Gets total number of challenges
- `getChallenge(challengeId)` - Gets challenge details
- `isParticipant(challengeId, userAddress)` - Checks if user joined
- `getParticipant(challengeId, userAddress)` - Gets user's participation data
- `getChallengeParticipants(challengeId)` - Gets list of participants

---

## Important Notes

### Contract Behavior
- **Challenge Creator** does NOT automatically join - must call `joinChallenge()` separately
- **Finalization** must happen after `endTime` before anyone can withdraw
- **Winners** get their stake back + share of losers' stakes
- **Losers** lose their staked amount
- **No partial completion** - it's all or nothing

### Activity Type Limitation
- Contract doesn't store activity type (running/cycling/etc)
- Frontend defaults to "running" üèÉ
- Consider adding this field to contract in future version

### Progress Tracking
- Contract doesn't track progress automatically
- Requires oracle (Lit Protocol) to verify Strava activities
- Currently shows 0% progress - will be updated when oracle integration is complete

### Gas Costs
- Creating challenge: ~150,000 gas
- Joining challenge: ~80,000 gas
- Withdrawing winnings: ~50,000 gas
- Use Sepolia testnet ETH for testing

---

## Next Steps

1. **Strava Integration**
   - Connect Strava OAuth (already implemented)
   - Implement activity tracking
   - Verify activities meet challenge requirements

2. **Oracle Integration**
   - Set up Lit Protocol oracle
   - Implement `markTaskComplete()` automation
   - Verify Strava activities on-chain

3. **Challenge Finalization**
   - Add automatic finalization after endTime
   - Consider adding finalization button in UI
   - Show finalization status in My Challenges

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Add loading states for blockchain calls
   - Show transaction pending states
   - Add transaction history view
   - Display gas estimates before transactions

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to mainnet or L2 (Optimism/Polygon)
   - Update RPC URLs to production endpoints
   - Add proper error logging
   - Implement retry logic for failed transactions

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not connected" Error
- Make sure wallet is connected via WalletConnect
- Check that you're on Sepolia testnet
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet

### Transaction Fails
- Ensure you have enough Sepolia ETH for gas + stake
- Check that challenge hasn't expired (for joining)
- Verify challenge is finalized (for withdrawing)

### Challenges Not Loading
- Check console for error messages
- Verify RPC endpoint is working: https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo
- Try refreshing by pulling down on the screen

### Can't Withdraw
- Challenge must be finalized first (after endTime)
- Someone must call `finalizeChallenge()` first
- Check if you've already withdrawn
