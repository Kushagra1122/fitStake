# Privacy Policy for FitStake

Last Updated: October 22, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how FitStake we collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our mobile application and connect your Strava account.

By authorizing the connection to your Strava account, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.


### Our Purpose

FitStake has been developed as a project for the ETHGlobal Online Hackathon. Our goal is to explore innovative ways to connect real-world activities with blockchain technology. As a hackathon project, this app is for demonstration and conceptual purposes.



## 1. Information We Collect

To provide our service, we must verify your fitness activities. When you grant FitStake access to your Strava account, we request permission to access the following data:

Profile Information: Your public-facing Strava name, username, and profile picture. This is used to identify you within the FitStake app.

Activity Data: We request access to your recent activities. This includes details such as activity type (e.g., "Run"), distance, and start time.

We do not access or store your private GPS route data, heart rate, or other personal health metrics. Our access is limited to the minimum data required for challenge verification.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Our single use for your Strava data is to verify your completion of running challenges on the FitStake platform.

Our process is as follows:

You join a group challenge and stake cryptocurrency via a smart contract.

You record your run (e.g., "Run 5km") using your official Strava app.

To verify completion, our service (or a decentralized agent) will check your recent Strava activities via the API to find an activity that matches the challenge criteria (e.g., a "Run" activity of at least "5km" completed within the challenge timeframe).

This verification result ("success" or "failure") is then used by the smart contract to correctly distribute the staked funds.

## 3. Data Retention and Deletion

We are committed to a minimal-retention policy.

Activity Data: Your Strava activity data is not stored on our servers. It is accessed on a just-in-time basis for the sole purpose of verification. Once the verification check is complete and the result is determined, the specific activity data is discarded.

Authentication Tokens: We securely store your Strava access_token and refresh_token to maintain the connection. This allows us to perform future verifications without requiring you to re-authenticate for every challenge. These tokens are deleted immediately upon your disconnection.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal Strava activity data with any third parties.

Smart Contracts: The result of your challenge (i.e., "success" or "failure") is a public event on the blockchain, as this is required for the smart contract to function. However, your personal activity details (like your exact distance, time, or profile information) are never written to the blockchain.

Other Users: Other participants in a challenge will see that you have successfully completed it, but they will not see your specific Strava activity details.

## 5. Your Rights and Control

You are in full control of your data.

Disconnecting In-App: You can disconnect your Strava account from FitStake at any time through the app's settings. This will immediately revoke our ability to access your Strava data, and your authentication tokens will be permanently deleted from our system.

Revoking via Strava: You can also revoke FitStake's access at any time from your Strava account settings page under "My Apps."

## 6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Your Strava authentication tokens are encrypted and stored in a secure environment. All API communication with Strava is conducted over an encrypted (HTTPS) connection.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.
